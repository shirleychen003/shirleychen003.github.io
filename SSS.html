        <h2>1. Overview </h2>
        <p>Have you ever had issues managing a subscription, forgotten about a free trial that you signed for, 
          or gone through a tedious process attempting to cancel a service? Subscription services are supposed 
          to be considered tools to facilitate everyday tasks, so why can so many problems arise within the 
          subscriptions framework? Subscriptions Super Simplified (3S) was created with the objective to solve 
          the aforementioned issues along with <b> facilitating any processes</b> while interacting with a subscription 
          service. By using this app, users are able to oversee their subscriptions with ease and eliminate any 
          <b>unnecessary stresses.</b> </br> </br>

          This app was created as a group project for Professor Olivier St. Cyr’s class <b>INF352: Information Design Studio II:
            How to Design </b> at the University of Toronto - St. George.

        <h2>2. Research </h2>
        <p>To deepen our understanding of the issues we were trying to address, my group and I conducted thorough research using
           both secondary and primary research methods. </br> </br></p>
        <p>Prior to conducting the primary research, we explored secondary sources to get an overview of the subject matter. 
          Research topics consisted of services and impact on subscriptions, existing public opinions and solutions, and current 
          business models. Our group then organized <b>a survey through Google forms and individual in person interviews </b> for our primary 
          research component. </br></br></p>
        <p>By the end of the research process, we had collected 77 anonymous responses in the Google forms, and interviewed answers from 
          16 different individuals. Since our target demographic was subscription users, we had two main requirements for the interviewees: 
          they must have at least one subscription and pay for it, and they must have cancelled or tried to cancel at least one service 
          in the past year. These interviews were conducted in person or over the phone. From our research, we were able to compile various 
          struggles users had with their subscriptions and then pinpoint the similarities. </br></br></p>
        <div id="stat">
          <subheading> <b>75% of the Google forms participants </b> had at least forgotten to cancel their subscription once and 
            <b>73% relied on their memory </b> track their subscriptions. </br></br> <subheading>
        </div>  
        <p>Using Miro, we created an affinity map where we organized all of our interview data into sections to identify key themes. Along with
           the issue of forgetting to cancel their subscriptions after a free trial due to lack of tracking methods, the interviewees expressed
            that there is often a complicated and frustrating cancellation process involved with subscription services. </p>

          <div class="selena_intro_text">
              <p>
                  An essential part in our project was the ideation process, in which my group and I were able to practice collaboration and exercise our creative thinking. <br><br>
                  Part 1 of the ideation process included creating a persona, an empathy map, As-Is scenario, and need statements. Firstly, we generated a 
                  persona using data from our research and designed a potential scenario that would benefit from using our app. Our persona was 
                  <b>Selena the Subscriber</b>, a busy university student with lots of subscriptions. <br><br>
              </p>
          </div>
          <p>To gain a deeper understanding of Selena’s <b>thoughts, motivations, and feelings,</b> we curated an empathy map. Quotes and expressed 
            feelings were derived from our research data. Using the empathy map, we created an As-Is scenario to walk through a potential real world 
            scenario that Selena would experience when facing an issue with a subscription. The mapped out As-Is scenario clearly communicated the 
            main pain points that Selena had.
          </p>
          <div class="project_image">
            <img src="images/SSS/empathy_asis.png" alt="Empathy Map and As-Is Scenario">
          </div>
          <p> Once those were all finished, we compiled a list of need statements inspired by the major pain points. The main concerns from our
             primary research consisted of <b>lack of subscription flexibility, simplicity, awareness and transparency,</b> which we made sure 
             to address in the need statements:</p>
          <div id="need_statements">
            <ul>
              <li> Selena <b>needs a way</b> to easily be able to cancel her subscription <b>so that</b> it is a simple, stress-free experience. </li>
              <li> Selena <b>needs a way</b> to manage her subscriptions <b>so that</b> she is aware of the subscriptions she has. </li>
              <li> Selena <b>needs a way</b> to modify her subscription if needed <b>so that</b> she is completely satisfied with what she is paying for. </li>
              <li> Selena <b>needs a way</b> to be fully informed about the service that she is subscribing to <b>so that</b> transparency is practiced. </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>Part 2 of the ideation process consisted of an “design dash” ideation process and creating a prioritization grid and a To-Be scenario.
             Additionally, we applied any feedback we got from Part 1 to this part.</p>
          <div class="project_image">
            <img src="images/SSS/group_ideation.png" alt="Group Work">
          </div>
          <p>The “design dash” ideation process involved the group setting a 5 minute timer to write down as many solution ideas we had 
            for the pain points that we recognized from the first part of our project. The brainstormed ideas could be both practical or 
            absurd. When the 5 minutes was up, we drew out the generated ideas and included a small description. </br> </p>
          <div class="project_image">
            <img src="images/SSS/SSS p1 ideas.png" alt="Part 1 - Ideas">
          </div>
          <p>The final part of the “design dash”  process was to vote on each idea’s feasibility <blue_text>(blue dots)</blue_text> and impact <red_text>(red dots)</red_text>. <b>How did 
            each idea expand user value? Did it alleviate pain? How feasible really is the idea?</b> Once we finalized our votes, we used a 
            prioritization grid to plot out the best solution to Selena’s various pain points. </p>

            <img src="images/SSS/SSS p2 ideas.png" alt="Part 2 + 3 - Ideas">
          </div>
          <p>Finally, to end off this thorough ideation process, we outlined a potential scenario with our persona of their actions, thoughts, and feelings using our
             proposed solution in a To-Be scenario and ensured that the pain points were addressed.</p>

        <h2>4. Prototypes Design and Evaluation </h2>
        <p>Following the completion of the ideation process, our team developed the first prototype, the Low-Fidelity Paper Prototype as shown below:
        </p>
        <div class="project_image">
          <img src="images/SSS/SSS lofi.png">
        </div>
        <p>We made sure to include a title for each screen, annotate the sketches, and follow the outline of a Sequential Storyboard so that the flow 
          of the app was organized and direct. We then conducted usability testing by having participants walk through the prototype and their 
          understanding of each page, being sure to use <a href = "https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">the 10 usability heuristics</a>. 
          Participants were also encouraged to express their thoughts and feelings out loud, implementing the think-aloud protocol. </br> </br></p>
        <p>Our two participants had somewhat different backgrounds, which illustrated the importance of including various perspectives in our trial
           since different ranges of feedback were provided. However, a shared, major concern that both participants had was the management of payment 
           with the app. They both suggested features to help with reminding to update the payment method, a way to change the payment, and a form 
           of feedback that communicates if their subscription has already been paid for.</p>
        <div class="project_image">
          <img src="images/SSS/usability_testing.png">
        </div>
        <p>We took the feedback from our Low-Fidelity Paper Prototype usability testing into consideration and produced Medium-Fidelity Prototype through Figma.
           Here are the final screens we had in our Figma:  </p>
        <div class="project_image">

        <div class="project_image">
          <img src="images/SSS/midfi2.png">
        </div>
        <p>Usability testing was also conducted for this prototype with two different individuals from the testing with the paper prototype. We still received
           some constructive feedback regarding payment management, but the participants still gave overall positive feedback.</p>

        <h2>5. Moving Forward </h2>
        <p>The main focus of this project was to ease any stresses when interacting with subscription services. Although I had personally experienced 
          some issues with subscriptions services in the past, I did not realize the extent of some of the issues that subscriptions users face. 
          Doing both primary and secondary research was <b> essential to ground my understanding around the issue, </b>making it easier to approach 
          the problem and have reasoning for any specific design decisions.</br> </br>
        </p>
        <p>Every detail during the process was crucial and facilitated any future tasks that were to be done. It was important to <b>trust the process</b>
           because as thorough as each step of the process was, every step was connected and the great deal of planning was eventually beneficial in 
           some way or another.</br> </br>
        </p>
        <p>In the future, it would be invaluable to run usability testing with more participants to receive <b>feedback or suggestions of any features that should be included </b>
          in our application. Additionally, with more time, my group and I would have loved to consider and implement every piece of feedback that 
          was given to us during the second round of usability testing for the Medium-Fidelity prototype. </br> </br>
        </p>
        <p>Overall, this project was an <b>immense milestone </b> for me in my UX journey since it was my first, official UX case study! It 
          taught me not only about the intricate aspects of a UX design project, but general project management skills as well. The project's 
          journey has been educational, highlighting the value of user feedback, iterative design, and the importance of simplicity in improving
           user subscription management. </br> </br>
