        <h2>1. Overview </h2>
        <p>Have you ever had issues managing a subscription, forgotten about a free trial that you signed for, 
          or gone through a tedious process attempting to cancel a service? Subscription services are supposed 
          to be considered tools to facilitate everyday tasks, so why can so many problems arise within the 
          subscriptions framework? Subscriptions Super Simplified (3S) was created with the objective to solve 
          the aforementioned issues along with <b> facilitating any processes</b> while interacting with a subscription 
          service. By using this app, users are able to oversee their subscriptions with ease and eliminate any 
          <b>unnecessary stresses.</b> </br> </br>

          This app was created as a group project for Professor Olivier St. Cyr’s class <b>INF352: Information Design Studio II:
            How to Design </b> at the University of Toronto - St. George.

        <h2>2. Research </h2>
        <p>To deepen our understanding of the issues we were trying to address, my group and I conducted thorough research using
           both secondary and primary research methods. </br> </br></p>
        <p>Prior to conducting the primary research, we explored secondary sources to get an overview of the subject matter. 
          Research topics consisted of services and impact on subscriptions, existing public opinions and solutions, and current 
          business models. Our group then organized <b>a survey through Google forms and individual in person interviews </b> for our primary 
          research component. </br></br></p>
        <p>By the end of the research process, we had collected 77 anonymous responses in the Google forms, and interviewed answers from 
          16 different individuals. Since our target demographic was subscription users, we had two main requirements for the interviewees: 
          they must have at least one subscription and pay for it, and they must have cancelled or tried to cancel at least one service 
          in the past year. These interviews were conducted in person or over the phone. From our research, we were able to compile various 
          struggles users had with their subscriptions and then pinpoint the similarities. </br></br></p>
        <div id="stat">
          <subheading> <b>75% of the Google forms participants </b> had at least forgotten to cancel their subscription once and 
            <b>73% relied on their memory </b> track their subscriptions. </br></br> <subheading>
        </div>  
        <p>Using Miro, we created an affinity map where we organized all of our interview data into sections to identify key themes.</p>
