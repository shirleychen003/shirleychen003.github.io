        <h2>1. Overview </h2>
        <p>Relationships and human interactions are one of the most important aspects of the human experience, playing a significant role
           in shaping our emotional well-being and overall happiness. When you make a mistake during social interactions, you are <b>at risk 
           of damaging your relationships or your own image.</b> </br> </br>

           Presenting your Social and Emotional Navigator, or SEN for short, a product where affective computing and generative AI have
            been incorporated into wearable technology to enhance your social interactions. SEN gathers data based on the user’s environment,
             such as facial expressions, vocal tone, and mannerisms, to deliver real-time emotional feedback and personalized recommendations
              on how to improve during your social encounters <b>because being yourself is never enough.</b> Through a speculative product
               website that features satirical features and promotional materials of the device, we aim to provoke discussion around the future 
               of emotional autonomy in an AI-dominated society. </br> </br>

          This was created as a group project for Professor Nusrat Jahan Mim’s class <b>Special Topics in Information Studies II: AI</b>
           at the University of Toronto - St. George.

        <h2>2. Research </h2>
        <p>Our project is grounded in three core ethical concerns: the erosion of user privacy through constant environmental surveillance
          (“soft biometrics”), the amplification of societal biases in training data, and the dangers of algorithmic opacity leading to digital 
          colonialism (McStay 2020, Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018; Couldry & Mejias, 2019). By situating SDI within broader critiques of IoT and 
          neoliberal data practices, we show how such technologies risk reinforcing structural inequalities under the guise of enhancing human 
          connection.
