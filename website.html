        <h2>1. Background </h2>
        <p> For my <b>INF352: Information Design Studio II: How to Design </b> class, one of the final assignments was to submit a website portfolio imitating 
            what I would potentially submit if I were applying to UX designer roles. I had little experience in development, so I quickly turned to using 
            the website builder SquareSpace. While the application was intuitive and easy to use, I felt that it offered limited flexibility in terms of
            customization beyond the provided templates. With encouragement from my peers, I set the objective to design and develop my own website.

          <p> Although I wanted shift away from the SquareSpace website, I still liked the formatting and general aesthetic of the portfolio website I 
            had made for my assignment, so I decided to try and replicate what it looked like on Figma while still adding my own creative flair.

          <p> Once I had finished my design or at least had a good idea of the vibe I wanted to go for, I started to code out my website. I had followed a

        <p> Overall, this was a really fun project for me to work on and I hope to continue to explore website building tools to make this website 
          (and/or any future websites I make) more dynamic and interactive :)
