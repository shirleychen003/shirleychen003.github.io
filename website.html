        <h2>1. Background </h2>
        <p> For my <b>INF352: Information Design Studio II: How to Design </b> class, one of the final assignments was to submit a website portfolio imitating 
            what I would potentially submit if I were applying to UX designer roles. I had little experience in development, so I quickly turned to using 
            the website builder SquareSpace. While the application was intuitive and easy to use, I felt that it offered limited flexibility in terms of
            customization beyond the provided templates. With encouragement from my peers, I set the objective to design and develop my own website.

            <h3>a) Design</h3>
            <p> Although I wanted shift away from the SquareSpace website, I still liked the formatting and general aesthetic of the portfolio website I 
              had made for my assignment, so I decided to try and replicate what it looked like on Figma while still adding my own creative flair.

              </br> 
              I decided to incroporate capybaras in my website's design since they're one of my favourite animals. I used the application ArtStudio to draw the 
              capybaras that you see on this website.

            </br>  </p>
            <h3>b) Development</h3>
            <p> Once I had finished my design (or at least had a good idea of the vibe I wanted to go for), I started to code out my website. For the initial development,
              I followed a <a href="https://youtu.be/FazgJVnrVuI?si=IfWNOBwVvTqNOTqN">YouTube video</a> to set up a basic structure. This video was mainly used for building 
              my navigation bar and informing me of the idea of mobile responsiveness, as I was unfamiliar with the concept before.
              <div class="website_img">
                <img src="images/website/hero_section.png" alt="Hero Section">
                <img_caption> Code of my Hero Section (all of my code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/shirleychen003/shirleychen003.github.io">my Github</a>)</img_caption>
              </div>
            Otherwise, there was a lot of testing and experimentation involved in the development process (shoutout to W3Schools and StackOverflow for troubleshooting purposes).
             Nonetheless, planning it out on Figma definitely helped with guidance and made the whole process more manageable.

        <p> 
          Overall, this was a really fun project for me to work on and I hope to continue to explore website building tools to make this website 
          (and/or any future websites I make) more dynamic and interactive :) I'm continuing to update it whenever I can by adding new pages, refining the design,
           and improving user experience. Now feel free to explore the different pages I built! </br> </br>
