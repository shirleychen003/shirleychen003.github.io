        <h2>1. Overview </h2>
        <p>Relationships and human interactions are one of the most important aspects of the human experience, playing a significant role
           in shaping our emotional well-being and overall happiness. When you make a mistake during social interactions, you are <b>at risk 
           of damaging your relationships or your own image.</b> </br> </br>

           Presenting your <b>S</b>ocial and <b>E</b>motional <b>N</b>avigator, or <b>SEN</b> for short, a product where affective computing and generative AI have
            been incorporated into wearable technology to enhance your social interactions. SEN gathers data based on the user’s environment,
             such as facial expressions, vocal tone, and mannerisms, to deliver real-time emotional feedback and personalized recommendations
              on how to improve during your social encounters <b>because being yourself is never enough.</b> Through a speculative product
               website that features satirical features and promotional materials of the device, we hoped to provoke discussion around the future 
               of emotional autonomy in an AI-dominated society. </br> </br>

          This speculative design was created as a group project for Professor Nusrat Jahan Mim’s class <b>INF482: Special Topics in Information Studies II - AI</b>
           at the University of Toronto - St. George.

        <h2>2. Research </h2>
        <p>Our project is grounded in three core ethical concerns: the erosion of user privacy through constant environmental surveillance 
          (“soft biometrics”), the amplification of societal biases in training data, and the dangers of algorithmic opacity leading to digital
           colonialism (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951720904386">McStay, 2020</a>; <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a.html">Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018</a>;
           <a href="https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/89511/1/Couldry_Data-colonialism_Accepted.pdf">Couldry & Mejias, 2019</a>). By situating SDI within 
           broader critiques of IoT and neoliberal data practices, we wanted to show how such technologies risk reinforcing structural inequalities, 
           despite the appearance of enhancing human connection. </br> </br>

           While our research showed that AI systems can show various forms of bias, such as gender or racial bias, our group decided to focus on AI’s
            <b>bias against neurodivergent individuals</b> after receiving feedback from our classmates and professor. Traditional affective computing systems
             often assume a universal model of emotional expression, which may exclude neurodivergent experiences. By using the 
             <b>Social-Emotional-Sensory Design Map</b>, we wanted to demonstrate how our AI product’s narrow emotional categories risks misinterpreting
              emotions and reinforcing bias, since neurodivergent users may experience a different, more nuanced range of emotions.

        <h2>3. Ideation </h2>
        <p>To execute our vision through speculative design, we wanted to create a product website that showcases the fictional company, SEN AI, 
          which promotes wearable affective computing devices paired with a mobile app that showcases their real-time social success metrics. All 
          website and app prototyping was done on Figma.

          </div>

          Additionally, to bring our product to life, our group had created scripts for demo videos to support our design process. One demo was 
          to showcase how neurodivergent individuals may experience bias using SEN in an interview scenario 
          (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y3IOFJS6j4hKYV5eStAk0EsIBy3b_qRD/view?usp=sharing">watch here</a>), 
          and another demo was created to show how SEN may not work as effectively due to external inhibiting factors, such as time processing 
          constraints and excessive volume, in a party scenario
           (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MnnG--Md43JKhN0rfPnsnxHORvbTws4E/view?usp=sharing">watch here</a>).

        <h2>4. Prototypes Design and Evaluation </h2>
        <p>Our product consists of two main components. Customers must first purchase either the reusable contact lenses or glasses. These are 
          designed to seamlessly integrate into daily life, collecting micro-expressions and other data points in real time. 
          <div class="website_img">

            <img_caption>Product page on website </img_caption>
          </div>

          The second component is an annual subscription to our Smart Data Interpretation (SDI) software, which processes the data and delivers 
          feedback. The lens collects micro-data from eye movements, pupil dilation, and facial muscle micro-expressions of their surrounding 
          individuals, which is transmitted as encrypted data wirelessly to the app. The user receives this feedback through their mobile dashboard,
           offering a customized guide for smoother, more normal and ‘perfect’ interactions.

          </div>

          In action, the product uses affective computing to analyze the social atmosphere around the user, which prompts an AI generated pop-up
           message in the user’s vision. This message provides real-time recommendations for the user on how to adapt their actions and offers 
           a customized guide for smoother, more normal, and more perfect interactions.

        <h2>5. Moving Forward </h2>
        <p>As we imagine the future of real-time emotional analysis through wearable technology, it is crucial to continue exploring both its technical 
          potential and its societal implications, especially as technology continues to develop in these specific areas. This speculative design 
          encourages us to think critically about how future technologies like SEN will shape our relationships, emotions, and social structures. 
          By embedding these tools into everyday objects, we risk the normalization of constant surveillance and emotional manipulation with both 
          strangers and loved ones. </br> </br>

          More dystopian features that could be considered for our product could include an emotional score system, where you are given more
           points the more you “act right”, or a pay-as-you-go system, where premium features are offered in the moment to ameliorate one’s 
           actions in social situations. These features would further highlight unintended consequences, such as emotional manipulation in 
           intimate relationships or dependency on AI for authentic social interactions. </br> </br>

           Even if SEN remains a speculative concept, it serves as a catalyst for critical conversations about the future entanglement of emotion, 
          technology, and society. Our project challenges us to rethink the role of AI in shaping human experiences, serving as a reminder to design
           technologies that are inclusive, ethical, and responsive to the diverse emotional needs of all users. Visit our official product website
