          So how did we address these issues? After conducting thorough research about the problem space, we followed a 3-step approach to
           develop and implement our solution. This allowed the team to manage complexity and ensure a cohesive integration of research, 
           technical development, and user experience. </br> </br>

        <subsection_header>Archival Documentation</subsection_header>
        <p>
          This process consisted of creating workflow documents and flowcharts for social media platforms to simplify the data download process
           and developing a glossary to help users understand and navigate their data packages.

        <p>
          Narrowing the scope to solely Instagram, any documents were then integrated into the project website as searchable PDFs, serving as a 
          guide for users to obtain their Instagram data. </br> </br>

        <p>
          Using Python and exported JSON files of Instagram data, scripts and a user-friendly GUI in Tkinter were developed for local-use. 
          This way, users were able to take uninterpretable data and convert it to a comprehensible form.

        <h2>1. Overview </h2>
        <p>While past generations may have used physical photo albums and diaries to leave their legacies, our digital-native generation uses 
          platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook to illustrate and tell their personal stories. Users lack reliable ways to safeguard 
          their digital identities and narratives in the face of platform obsolescence, privacy risks, and shifting technological landscapes. 
        </br> </br>
        Preservr explored how an integrated tool suite can empower individuals to preserve their digital footprints while addressing challenges
         of organization, accessibility, sustainability, and heritage. The integrated tool suite allows people to curate their digital footprints 
         by bridging the personal, cultural, and technical to preserve meaningful content for years to come.
          </br></br>

          This was a capstone project created for Professor Maher Elshakankiri’s class <b>INF453: Capstone Project</b> at the University of Toronto - St. George.

        <h2>2. Research </h2>
        <p>To get a better understanding of the current landscape of social media in relation to digital archiving, our group identified
          <b> 5 key subject areas </b>to explore in a literature review:
          <div id="skills_list">
            <ol>
              <li>Digital archiving standards</li>
              <li>Social media platforms and their functionality</li>
              <li>Ethical and legal implications</li>
              <li>Existing tools</li>
              <li>Social media as cultural heritage</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          Case studies on personal digital archiving and the existing tools were also analyzed to gain a greater understanding of the 
          current landscape. Beyond examining the landscape of the current tensions that exist in the areas that Preservr is founded upon, 
          this literature review aimed to contextualize that information into actionable insights and factors that guide the ongoing
           development of Preservr as a tool and its ethos. 
        </br> </br>
        After completing our literature review, we identified 30 potential social media platforms that could be explored. The scope 
        eventually was refined to 4 of arguably the most popular platforms: Instagram, Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Tik Tok,
         in which each group member was assigned a platform to create respective archiving workflow documentations. After presenting our 
         findings to one another and deliberate discussion, the group decided to solely focus on Instagram to execute our project’s proof of concept.

      <div class="content">
        <h2>3. Ideation </h2>
        <p> From the beginning, to maintain structure to the project, we outlined key five objectives:
          <div id="skills_list">
            <ol>
              <li><b>Recognize and understand existing gaps</b> by conducting literature reviews and researching existing techniques, 
                frameworks, and tools for personal social media archiving.</li>
              <li><b>Design workflows </b> to download personal social media data and create effective step-by-step guidelines for individuals 
                to easily comprehend</li>
              <li><b>Create comprehensive archive data glossaries</b>that aid users in deciding what they want to keep for their personal 
                archive by offering description, location, and type of all files present in a data package</li>
              <li><b>Develop a GUI-based data visualization application</b> that gives greater context to the data folder users are given by social media platforms, thereby allowing the archive to emphasize its meaning to users to implicitly justify preservation efforts</li>
              <li><b>Build and publish a user-friendly website </b>that offers access to the tools, resources, and instructions necessary for personal digital archiving.</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          </br>

          Additionally, we set seven key outcomes achieve these objectives:
          <div id="skills_list">
            <ol>
              <li><b>Identification of Relevant Literature and Solutions to Existing Gaps: </b> Identifying applicable literature and their 
                limitations, and recognizing existing gaps in the personal digital archiving space that we plan to address with our proposed 
                solution. </li>
              <li><b>Decision Trees and Workflow Documentation:</b> Complementary step-by-step guidelines for data extraction for a minimum 
                of four social media platforms. </li>
              <li><b>Archive File Glossary:</b> A comprehensive archive glossary for Instagram data packages which breaks down the purpose,
                 location, and archival context of each file within the archive to enable users to make efficient curation decisions.</li>
              <li><b>Data Visualization Application: </b> A multi-purpose GUI-based data visualization tool for Instagram package data which enables users to gather insights about their social media activity from their archive immediately </li>
              <li><b>Project Website:</b> A website which tackles the problem statement by hosting the integrated tool suite and educational materials to enable social media users to productively practice personal digital archiving.</li>
              <li><b>Final Presentation:</b> A visual overview of the project, suitable for presentations in academic and public settings.</li>
              <li><b>Develop New and Existing Skills: </b>This project will help develop our skills involving interacting with social media 
                tools, web development, Python application development, and data extractions, along with deepening our understanding of digital 
                preservation and curation practices, including long-term archive management. </li>
            </ol>
          </div>
        </p>
        </br>

        <p>Our group had initially identified 18 different explorable social media platforms, but due to time constraints, we refined our scope 
          to the platforms Instagram, X, Facebook, and Tik Tok since these were also arguably the most used platforms in the list. However, after creating workflow 
          documentation for the download process of each platform and realizing the complexities of each platform,  we chose to focus solely on Instagram
           to execute our project’s proof of concept. </p>

        <h2>5. Moving Forward </h2>
        <p>Our group has various improvements that we would’ve loved to implement if we had more time. Firstly, our scope was narrowed to focus on just
           Instagram, but future versions would aim to <b>integrate more platforms </b>as we had initially planned. These platforms could be combined 
           into a unified archive that can be accessed as a timeline of someone’s memory. We also would have liked to experiment with <b>cloud processing, </b>
            as our version had no cloud support or web-hosted tools. Future iterations would involve developing logistics for online access and storage,
             and continuous data syncing and retrieval. 
            </br> 
             Finally, other innovative features would include <b>developing experimental datasets for social media archive data </b>
             to test any tools more easily and to protect privacy and <b>integrating AI tools</b>, such as chatbot summaries of personal archive trends
             or conversation topics, for deeper archive insights.  
            </br> </br>
            This project helped immensely with developing my knowledge in archiving, particularly digital archiving, as well as developed my skills 
            in software development and project management. If you're interested in accessing the mentioned resources and/or more in-depth descriptions
