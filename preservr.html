        <h2>1. Overview </h2>
        <p>While past generations may have used physical photo albums and diaries to leave their legacies, our digital-native generation uses 
          platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook to illustrate and tell their personal stories. Users lack reliable ways to safeguard 
          their digital identities and narratives in the face of platform obsolescence, privacy risks, and shifting technological landscapes. 
        </br> </br>
        Preservr explored how an integrated tool suite can empower individuals to preserve their digital footprints while addressing challenges
         of organization, accessibility, sustainability, and heritage. The integrated tool suite allows people to curate their digital footprints 
         by bridging the personal, cultural, and technical to preserve meaningful content for years to come.

        <h2>2. Research </h2>
        <p>To get a better understanding of the current landscape of social media in relation to digital archiving, our group identified
          <b> 5 key subject areas </b>to explore in a literature review:
          <div id="skills_list">
            <ol>
              <li>Digital archiving standards</li>
              <li>Social media platforms and their functionality</li>
              <li>Ethical and legal implications</li>
              <li>Existing tools</li>
              <li>Social media as cultural heritage</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <div class="website_img">
            <img src="images/capstone/socialmedia.png" alt="Social Media Platforms and Functionality">
            <img_caption> Social Media Platforms and Functionality Insights - Sehar</img_caption>
          </div>
          <div class="website_img">
            <img src="images/capstone/archival_standards.png" alt="Archival Standards">
            <img_caption>Archival Standards - Francesca</img_caption>
          </div>
          <div class="website_img">
            <img src="images/capstone/existing_tools.png" alt="Existing Tools and Limitations ">
            <img_caption> Existing Tools and Limitations - Luca</img_caption>
          </div>
          <div class="website_img">
            <img src="images/capstone/ethics.png" alt="Ethics, Privacy, and Law Implications">
            <img_caption> Ethics, Privacy, and Law Implications - Shirley</img_caption>
          </div>

          Case studies on personal digital archiving and the existing tools were also analyzed to gain a greater understanding of the 
          current landscape. Beyond examining the landscape of the current tensions that exist in the areas that Preservr is founded upon, 
          this literature review aimed to contextualize that information into actionable insights and factors that guide the ongoing
           development of Preservr as a tool and its ethos. 
        </br> </br>
        After completing our literature review, we identified 30 potential social media platforms that could be explored. The scope 
        eventually was refined to 4 of arguably the most popular platforms: Instagram, Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Tik Tok,
         in which each group member was assigned a platform to create respective archiving workflow documentations. After presenting our 
         findings to one another and deliberate discussion, the group decided to solely focus on Instagram to execute our project’s proof of concept.
